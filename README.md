# Titanic
Made for the Kaggle (kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) Titanic competition (predicting whether or not a passenger on board the Titanic survives based off a number of features).  Achieved 79% accuracy, which was at the top 8% of over 19,000 competitors at time of submission.  Created using Estimator and Keras TensorFlow APIs.

This runs on a Google Colab instance working off of Google Drive (it has just been imported to github for visibility).  Feel free to use, just make sure to configure directory locations so they work for your environment.
